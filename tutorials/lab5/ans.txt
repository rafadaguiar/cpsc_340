Consindering the same network layout for the tests, doing PCA will likely result in lower accuracy (because we are using less components to train) and in a simpler model that can be computed in less time. Thus PCA can be helpful in order to avoid overfitting and to compute models faster. As a remainder, PCA is sensitive to scaling, so it's a good practice to scale the data before runing it.

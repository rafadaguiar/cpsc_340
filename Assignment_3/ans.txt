1) Model:  MClean 
           Sensitivity =  0.9426605505  Specificity =  0.890625

2) RIncome has less residual error.

3) Model:  RIncome 
           Sensitivity =  0.9220183486  Specificity =  0.984375 
   Model:  RAge 
           Sensitivity =  0.9082568807  Specificity =  0.953125 
   Model:  RBoth 
           Sensitivity =  0.9220183486  Specificity =  0.984375

a) All the models with value imputation helped in increasing the specificity value, suggesting that it might be a good technique to use depending on your data.
b) Yes, RIncome has the smallest error in imputation and is the best classifier. Although, I would say that it is not always the case. For example, RBoth had more residual error and it is still as good classifier as RIncome.
